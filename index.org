*NOTE:* This document is not yet complete though it is commited ! It is
being worked on continuously.

* Problem
  The analytics of Virtual-labs are generated by awstats. Awstats
  provides a separate dashboard for viewing these statistics. A simple
  dashboard which displays the total views and hits of the site is
  required. This would help keep us informed on the usage of our
  labs.

* Objective
  The objective of this exercise is to display the usage of
  virtual-labs in terms of visits and number of pages viewed.  

* Plan
  A script which would extract the required fields from the parsed
  awstats text files and display the data in the form of an html page.

  Awstats generates parsed text files which contain the statisctics in
  text format. The required data from these text files needs to be
  extracted and displayed in a html page.

* Implementation
  Currently the labs are hosted in 3 different locations namely:
  + AWS
  + Containers at VLEAD
  + vlab.co.in 
  The statistics of AWS and labs on containers at VLEAD can be
  obtained. 

* Work Plan
** TODO Prepare the document
** TODO Discuss on how to meet the requirement
   
** TODO Figure out he various location of the labs
   There are several locations the labs are situated AWS, deploy,
   separate containers. How to display the combined output of all the
   labs is yet to be decided.
** TODO Build the scripts
** TODO Test the scripts.
** TODO Send the url to Amrita to update on vlab.co.in
   They need to create a hyperlink on their landing page which needs
   to link to this url.
** TODO Include the url in analytics.virtual-labs.ac.in
** TODO Update the analytics.virtual-labs.ac.in 
   The current list of labs (as per their location) is not updated on
   analytics.virtual-labs. This needs to be updated.
